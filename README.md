# Airplane Game with Obstacle Destruction

## Version 1.0.1

Created by Claude 3.5 Sonnet (AI Assistant)

## Game Description

This is a 3D airplane game where the player controls an airplane, avoiding obstacles and destroying them to gain points. The game is built using HTML with embedded JavaScript and CSS, utilizing Three.js for 3D rendering.

## Features

- 3D graphics rendered with Three.js
- Player-controlled airplane with smooth movement
- Randomly generated obstacles and clouds
- Shooting mechanism to destroy obstacles
- Distance tracking and obstacle destruction count
- Time-based gameplay with a 60-second limit
- Collision detection and game over screen
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the airplane:
   - Up Arrow: Increase altitude
   - Down Arrow: Decrease altitude
   - Left Arrow: Move left
   - Right Arrow: Move right
2. Press the Spacebar to shoot and destroy obstacles
3. Avoid colliding with obstacles
4. Try to fly as far as possible and destroy as many obstacles as you can within the 60-second time limit

## Technical Details

- Structure: Single HTML file
- Scripting: Embedded JavaScript
- Styling: Embedded CSS
- 3D Library: Three.js (version r128)
- Rendering: WebGL

## Development Notes

This game was created by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI language model developed by Anthropic. The game demonstrates the capability of AI to generate complex, interactive web applications with 3D graphics.

The development process involved:
1. Structuring the HTML file to include all necessary elements
2. Embedding CSS for styling the user interface
3. Implementing the game logic and 3D rendering using JavaScript and Three.js
4. Creating the 3D scene and airplane model
5. Implementing player controls and movement
6. Generating and managing obstacles and clouds
7. Adding collision detection and shooting mechanics
8. Implementing the game logic, including scoring and time limit
9. Designing the user interface and HUD
10. Optimizing performance and ensuring responsiveness

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future development include:
- Adding power-ups for temporary special abilities
- Implementing distinct levels with increasing difficulty
- Creating a multiplayer mode for competitive gameplay
- Enhancing graphics and adding more detailed 3D models
- Implementing sound effects and background music
- Adding a high score system with local storage
- Separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct files for better code organization
